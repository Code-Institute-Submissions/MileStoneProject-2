                <hr class="block-divider block-divider-lg ">
                <p> are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and 1971, with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television
                    series The Monkees which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork; and English actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised
                    by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.</p>

                <hr class="block-divider block-divider-lg ">
                <p> The four actor-musicians were allowed only limited roles in the recording studio for the first few months of their five-year career as "the Monkees ". This was due in part to the amount of time required to film the television series. Nonetheless,
                    Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from the beginning, and Peter Tork contributed limited guitar work on the sessions produced by Nesmith. They eventually fought for the right to collectively supervise all musical output under
                    the band's name. The television show was canceled in 1968, but the band continued to record music through 1971.</p>
                <p>A revival of interest in the television show came in 1986, which led to a series of reunion tours and new records. The group has reunited and toured several times since then with different line-ups and varying degrees of success.</p>

                    forming the core of the band and Nesmith continuing to join them occasionally.</p>

                <p> In the 1990s, the Monkees continued to record new material. In 1993, Dolenz and Jones worked together on a television commercial, and another reunion tour was launched with the two of them in 1994. Rhino Records (which in August 1994 acquired
                    the complete Monkees back audio and video catalog, as well as the rights to the Monkees name and official logo, under an agreement with Rafelson and Schneider) re-issued all the original LPs on CD, each of which included between three
                    and six bonus tracks of previously unreleased or alternate takes; the first editions came with collectable trading cards. </p>
                <hr class="block-divider block-divider-lg ">
                <p>Dolenz, Jones and Tork appeared in a 1995 episode of Boy Meets World, but not as themselves; Tork appeared in two episodes as Topanga Lawrence's father Jedediah. </p>
                <hr class="block-divider block-divider-lg ">
                <p>Their eleventh album Justus was released in 1996. It was the first since 1968 on which all four original members performed and produced. Justus was produced by the Monkees, all songs were written by one of the four Monkees, and it was
                    recorded using only the four Monkees for all instruments and vocals, which was the inspiration for the album title and spelling (Justus = Just Us). </p>
                <hr class="block-divider block-divider-lg ">
                <p>The trio of Dolenz, Jones, and Tork reunited again for a successful 30th anniversary tour of American amphitheaters in 1996, while Nesmith joined them onstage in Los Angeles to promote the new songs from Justus. For the first time since
                    the brief 1986 reunion, Nesmith returned to the concert stage for a tour of the United Kingdom in 1997, highlighted by two sold-out concerts at Wembley Arena in Wembley Park, London. This was a very fitting venue, as from 30 June to
                    2 July 1967 the Monkees had been the first group to headline on their own at the Empire Pool, as the Arena was then called. </p>
                <hr class="block-divider block-divider-lg ">
                <p>The full quartet also appeared in an ABC television special titled Hey, Hey, It's the Monkees, which was written and directed by Nesmith and spoofed the original series that had made them famous. Following the UK tour, Nesmith declined
                    to continue future performances with the Monkees, having faced harsh criticism from the British music press for his deteriorating musicianship. Tork noted in DVD commentary that "In 1966, Nesmith had learned a reasonably good version
                    of the famous 'Last Train to Clarksville' guitar lick, but in 1996, Mike was no longer able to play it " and so Tork took over the lead guitar parts. </p>
                <hr class="block-divider block-divider-lg ">
                <p>Nesmith's departure from the tour was acrimonious. Jones was quoted by the Los Angeles Times as complaining that Nesmith "made a new album with us. He toured Great Britain with us. Then all of a sudden, he 's not here. Later, I hear rumors
                    he's writing a script for our next movie. Oh, really? That 's bloody news to me. He's always been this aloof, inaccessible person... the fourth part of the jigsaw puzzle that never quite fit in. " </p>
                <hr class="block-divider block-divider-lg ">
                <p>Peter Tork, Micky Dolenz, and Davy Jones appeared in the 1995 movie "The Brady Bunch Movie ".

                <p> Tork, Jones, and Dolenz toured the United States in 1997, after which the group took another hiatus until 2001 when they once again reunited to tour the United States. However, this tour was also accompanied by public sniping. Dolenz and
                    Jones had announced that they had "fired " Tork for his constant complaining and threatening to quit. Tork was quoted as saying that, as well as the fact he wanted to tour with his own band, "Shoe Suede Blues. " Tork told WENN News
                    he was troubled by the overindulgence in alcohol by other members of the tour crew: </p>
                <hr class="block-divider block-divider-lg ">
                <p>Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones fired me just before the last two shows of our 35th anniversary tour. I'm both happy and sad over the whole thing. I always loved the work onstage—but I just couldn't handle the backstage problems. I'd given
                    them 30 days notice that I was leaving so my position is that I resigned first and then they dropped me. Thank God I don't need the Monkees anymore...I'm a recovering alcoholic and haven't had a drink in several years. I'm not against
                    people drinking—just when they get mean and abusive. I went on the anniversary tour with the agreement that I didn't have to put up with drinking and difficult behavior offstage. When things weren't getting better, I gave the guys
                    notice that I was leaving in 30 days for good. </p>
                <hr class="block-divider block-divider-lg ">
                <p>Tork later stated in 2011 that the alcohol played only a small role and Tork then said, "I take full responsibility for the backstage problems on the 2001 tour. We were getting along pretty well until I had a meltdown. I ticked the other
                    guys off good and proper and it was a serious mistake on my part. I was not in charge of myself to the best of my ability – the way I hope I have become since. I really just behaved inappropriately, honestly. I apologized to them.
                    "
                </p>
                <hr class="block-divider block-divider-lg ">
                <p> Jones and Dolenz went on to tour the United Kingdom in 2002, but Tork declined to participate. Jones and Dolenz toured the United States one more time as a duo in 2002, and then split to concentrate on their own individual projects. With
                    different Monkees citing different reasons, the group chose not to mark their 40th anniversary in 2006.</p>

                <hr class="block-divider block-divider-lg ">
                <p> In October 2010, Jones stated that a reunion marking the band's 45th anniversary was a possibility. Noted Monkees biographer Andrew Sandoval commented in The Hollywood Reporter that he "spent three years cajoling them to look beyond their
                    recent differences (which included putting aside solo projects to fully commit to the Monkees).</p>
                <hr class="block-divider block-divider-lg">
                <p>"An Evening with The Monkees: The 45th Anniversary Tour commenced on May 12, 2011 in Liverpool, England, before moving to North America in June and July for a total of 43 performances. Sandoval noted, "Their mixed feelings on the music
                    business and their long and winding relationship weighed heavily, but once they hit the stage, the old magic was apparent. For the next three months...[they brought] the music and memories to fans in the band's grandest stage show
                    in decades. Images from their series and films flashed on a huge screen behind them; even Rolling Stone, whose owner, Jann Wenner, has vowed to keep them out of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, gushed." Nesmith did not take part in
                    the tour, which grossed approximately $4 million. </p>
                <hr class="block-divider block-divider-lg">
                <p>On August 8, 2011, the band cancelled ten last-minute shows due to what was initially reported as "internal group issues and conflicts", though Tork later confirmed "there were some business affairs that couldn't be coordinated correctly.
                    We hit a glitch and there was just this weird dislocation at one point." Jones clarified that "the (45th Anniversary) tour was only supposed to go until July. And it was great, the best time we've had because we're all on the same
                    page now. We gelled onstage and off. But then more dates were being added. And more. And then the next thing we knew, they were talking about Japan, Australia, Brazil, and we were like, 'Wait a second. This is turning into something
                    more than a tour.' We were doing 40 songs a night, plus other material. Some of these shows were 2​1⁄2 hours long. Then there was the travel, getting to the next venue with no time to revive. The audiences were great. But, let's face
                    it, we're not kids."</p>
